# Structure
- One contiguous file with 3 years data - read & keep stitching onto a datatable, discard any older entries (can always manually re-spec to include timeframe later)
- parse down to (start now w/) one quarter - OR does it make more sense to to land app season vs. winter (roughly semi-annual, but more delay)
- start with highlights (manual & semi-automated text); future -- comparatives with previous year quarter

## seperate endeavour
rough mass accounting via steps in wwtp - however will likely need to be unique for each plant (maybe set up for Stratford as test)

# Haulage
Amounts are variously reported under the four parameters: **HaulVol, HaulMass, HaulMassOffSite, and HauledVol** (of which HaulMass only exists in one facility, 5271), with the units either as kg, cubic meter per day, or cubic meter.  The export produces daily values, therefore all values are converted to cubic meter associated with the datestamp.

# Manual things
Do these on embedded excel

## Mass linkage
- e.g. Waterloo receiving from Kitchener, Preston from Galt : these may be double-counted until the lineage is sorted
- leachate - mass email from Jisna out to RHMs

facet by region - will help RHM, when looking at GP $

facet by flow range? or population served will auto-correlate BUT population isn't going to be updated

facet by class? - no - inaccuracies

cost per hub - Witte's sheet divided by contract durations
