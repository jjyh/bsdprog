# Overview

Ontario approved the Canada Council of Ministers of the Environment's Approach and the supporting Guidance Document for the Beneficial Use of Municipal Biosolids, Municipal Sludge and Treated Septage (2012) which present best management practices, and encourage the beneficial use and sound management of municipal biosolids across Canada.

The Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks' (MECP) 2025 mandate for OCWA is for it to deliver on municipal infrastructure resiliency, including supporting resource recovery from waste, and working with OCWA's clients to optimize their wastewater facilities. OCWA's 2025 to 2027 Business Plan, as part of Strategic Direction 3 (Supporting Climate Action and Environmental Stewardship), commits the Agency to working with interested clients to identify and implement new waste diversion and resource recovery opportunities in their communities and where feasible, to close the loop and sustainably manage biosolids storage and disposal.

Ontario Clean Water Agency's (OCWA) Residuals Resources Management Program aims to centralize residuals information systematically , align practices to policies and client priorities, and share market, technology and emerging issues reviews for operations reference.

*Climate, public health risks Managing risks requires consideration of future climate, infrastructure scenarios (planning for tomorrow); integrating adaptation measure in planning means protecting operational resilience, community health, and economic sustainability.*

*Wastewater residuals present potential hazards if not properly managed, but also entails an opportunity to better monitor its quality & application, which will facilitate OCWA to communicate transparently on an evidence-basis to client & users.*

# Structure

The Residuals Resources Management Program is structured in two streams:

1.  Core Program will create an internal inventory and benchmark from available OCWA operations & financial records. Regular reviews of policy, OCWA practices, and emerging issues will be conducted. Holistic consideration of these primarily technical information will translate into actionable insights, to be shared with operations management & procurement.

2.  Initiatives Development examines opportunities to implement improved residuals management. This includes technology and funding opportunities review, practice optimization, assessment of client and state-of-infrastructure priorities to identify candidate facilities.

Both streams, especially (1) will be made transparent to operations and management staff with the aim of establishing a collaborative & evidence-based program. Information pipelines will be established for regular update & reproducibility, with production documentation and "live" summaries made available on Sharepoint.

# Detailed Approach

## Core Program

The core program will canvas the current state of residuals handling in OCWA facilities. The main strands of information to be organized are listed below.

1.  OCWA facilities metadata, e.g. location, permit, hub, client, population, holding capacity, treatment process, geographical context
2.  Inventory of residuals quantity and quality
3.  Market landscape including reference regional and quality-based ranges. Both external costs (hauling & disposal), climate impacts, and nutrient/NASM valuation\
4.  Policy, regulations, and emerging issues review

Useable outcomes from the above inventory canvassing work:

1.  Data record & quality gaps will be made evident. Condensed and visualized gaps will be shared to be transparent about the bases (and lacks thereof) for the subsequent outcomes. Regional & logistical (e.g. by VoR) geographical clustering will be plotted & made visible within OCWA for planning reference.

    *Articulate the opportunities lost due to data gaps (rather than it being just a problem) - a social contract of give and get;*

2.  Priorities and risks (capacity or quality hotspots) & opportunities (landfill/cost abnormalities) will be identified tracked in a registry

3.  Benchmarks (e.g. production rates & quality, costs) and action triggers will be established based on a blend of hard limits and quantified distribution from the inventory exercise.

    *build economic case; recognize uncertainty*

4.  With consideration of policies, regulation and historical operations handling, establish a reference "Plinko" board/flowchart of actions. There is potential duplication/cross-feed with:

    1.  Lagoon Listing SD2 (Angela compliance hotspots)
    2.  Lagoon SOP (consult Raj & James)
    3.  Ops checklist for residuals handling e.g. pre NASM/haulage checks

5.  Reference information for operations management

    1.  Regulatory Changes Monitoring ("delegate" this to external)
    2.  Scientific/political/social risk factor scans ("delegate" this to external)
    3.  VOR & contract/procurement templates for haulage/NASM/disposal

6.  An information gathering "pipeline" protocol that will be published on Sharepoint, such that this exercise is reproducible and which may serve as reference for other IPOTS data gathering efforts.

    *Hardwiring so it works continuously & transparent (trusted)*

Data Notes

-   org number is unique as it is assigned by finance during contracts and will be common WISKI, SCADA and LRDC

    -   versus facility number (N.B. the ones that don't have a number might fall under a bigger client & facility)

-   Some regions don't use wiski -- Huron Elgin, Kitchener, Peel

    Is biosolids data always in "Blsq" station in WISKI

    2.Biosolids report -- is there quantity besides quality?  Or that is in annual plant reports

    Can we go "up" a level -- e.g. all the biosolids quality & quantity from all the plants instead of generating for every plant.  NO

## Lagoons
Lagoons, e.g. status, inspections, clean-out undertakings
no depths collected in key sheet
assume 1.5m in facultative - typical WW (but then to storage cells)
(4m aerated and 0.45 in aerobic)
de-sludge every 10-20 years
maintain freeboard of 1m (max depth of 1.5m liquid for facultative)

solids removed from a lagoon system can be land applied if
the lagoon cell has not received raw sewage for three months or longer and the lagoon has been designed and operated according to MOE guidelines (OMAF, 2003)
